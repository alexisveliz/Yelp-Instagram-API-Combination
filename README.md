# Restaurant Vibes

This app uses Yelp API and Instagram API to display photos and reviews for a restaurant to get a feeling of what the place is like.

TO RUN:
Currently, the project is still fragmented and will not be fully combined until the final submission.

To run the Yelp API, run Connection.py

To run the Instagram API, run ConnectionInstagramScript.py

The UI is built using [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/). To run, first download bottle using `pip install bottle` or another method mentioned in the Bottle website. Then run main.py and navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
