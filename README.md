# Restaurant Vibes

This app uses Yelp API and Instagram API to display photos and reviews for a restaurant to get a feeling of what the place is like. Currently, this prototype version searched the term "Thai" for locations in either "Los Angeles," "San Francisco," or "Seattle." Based on this search, it will output the top location based on Yelp and an image of the place from Instagram.

### To Run

The UI is built using [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/). To run, first download bottle using `pip install bottle` or another method mentioned in the Bottle website. Then run main.py and navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
